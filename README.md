**Brief Bio.**
I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Vision Group at the University of Amsterdam and a senior researcher in the Computer Vision and Geometry lab at ETH Zurich.
I have obtained my PhD in Computer Vision from TU Munich under the supervision of Prof. Daniel Cremers in 2015. Previously, I received a masters degree in civil engineering from the University of Technology Federico Santa Maria in Valparaiso, Chile in 2008 supported by a DAAD fellowship program. Before I studied computer science at TU Dresden and the University of Technology Sydney and obtained a master degree (Diplom) from TU Dresden in 2007.
